Modulation Considerations


Symbol and corresponding phase shift:
according to https://scdn.rohde-schwarz.com/ur/pws/dl_downloads/dl_application/application_notes/1gp105/1GP105_1E_Generation_of_IEEE_802154_Signals.pdf

11 -> 45°
01 -> 135°
00 -> 225°
10 -> 314°


Using a frequency of a channel in the 2450 MHz band:

Aiming for channel 21, 2455 MHz -> required frequency: 5 MHz

32 instructions per period

Required clock frequency: 5 MHz * 32 = 160 MHz

->	not feasible, max clock frequency is 133 MHz
	Use 128 MHz clock frequency, corresponding to 4 MHz
	[TODO: not too much attenuation?]


Archiving the required bit rate of 250 kbit/s:

From https://scdn.rohde-schwarz.com/ur/pws/dl_downloads/dl_application/application_notes/1gp105/1GP105_1E_Generation_of_IEEE_802154_Signals.pdf:
Required rates	2000 kChip/s / 250 kbit/s / 62.5 kSym/s
			1 Symbol = 4 Bits = 32 Chips

We decided to spread the bits that we plan to transfer to achieve O-QPSK, this means that we transmit approximately double the amount of bits
Example:
Bit sequence to be transmitted	10011100
Bit sequence provided to the PIO	10000111110100
Length of the bit sequence that will be sent: (original length * 2) - 2
[TODO: How exactly does the bit rate need to match? Does it play a role that we don’t transmit exactly double the original length?]

We need to transmit 2 000 000 modulated symbols per second -> 500 ns per modulated symbol
1 period takes 250 ns (= 1 / 4 MHz)
-> only two periods per symbol


[TODO:	is two periods per symbol enough?
Alternatives:	Use mapping of symbol to phase-shift that requires just 8 instructions]
